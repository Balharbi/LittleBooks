# Start Modeling Early: Outline of Version 2



#. Foundations: Computing
    1. Why?
        a. Why is modeling important?
        b. Why are you building a model?  The purpose drives the model.  There's no important metric for the quality of a model other than whether it serves the purpose.

#. Foundations: Functions and relationships
    1. Informal from graphics
    #. Formal from fits
    #. What do they mean
        a. Graphs
        #. Slopes and effect size
        #. R^2
    #. Complex models
        a. You won't need them much, but if you must, try `poly()`
        #. Multiple variables is often more important than complex forms.
#. Multiple Variables
    1. Main effects
    #. Interaction
    #. Partial derivatives
    #. Adjustment -- holding covariates constant
    #. R^2 goes up and the problems of inference
#. Inference
    1. Equivalence to the t-test and the p-test.
#. Proportions
