## Start Teaching with R: Outline


Random list of things to include:
* RStudio introduction
* Packages and why to use them
* The mosaic package and others that we recommend
* Minimal R reference
* Rmd
* Umbrella for other books
* Error messages.  Things to look for in error messages.
    * overwriting names
    * recycling vectors
    * factors and characters
* Data
    * `data()`
    * Group data with Google forms
    * `fetchData()` and requesting a repository name
    * distributing other kinds of files, e.g. templates for .Rmd, scripts, ...
* Style
    * Don't use one-letter names in your examples.  Your students will pick this up and end up saying things like `c = makeFun(x~x)`, which will mask `base::c()` and mess everything up until you `remove(c)`
