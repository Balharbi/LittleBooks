Teaching Statistics with R and RStudio

This workshop will introduce participants to teaching applied statistics
courses using computing in an integrated way.  The presenters have been using R
to teach statistics to undergraduates at all levels for the last decade and
will share their approach and some of their favorite examples.  Topics will
include workflow in the RStudio environment, providing novices with a powerful
but manageable set of tools, data visualization, resampling and randomization
methods, and how to emphasize modeling throughout the curriculum.  Much of this
will be facilitated using the mosaic package.

The workshop is designed to be accessible to those with little or no experience teaching
with R, and will provide participants with skills, examples, and resources that
they can use in their own teaching.
