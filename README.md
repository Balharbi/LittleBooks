### Outline

This project consists of several short books that are inter-related.

1. Start Teaching with R
    Directory: `Starting`
2.  The Core of a Traditional Course
    Directory: `Traditional`
3. Simulation-Based Inference
    Directory: `Simulation`
4. Functions and Formulas
    Directory: `Functions`
5. Teaching with Internet Services
    Directory: `Internet`
6. Start with Modeling
    Directory: `Modeling`

Outlines for the individual chapters are in the `Outline.Rmd` file in each directory.

## Overview

Some general comments about the project as a whole.

## Start Teaching with R: Outline


Random list of things to include:
* RStudio introduction
* Packages and why to use them
* The mosaic package and others that we recommend
* Minimal R reference
* Rmd
* Umbrella for other books
* Error messages.  Things to look for in error messages.
    * overwriting names
    * recycling vectors
    * factors and characters
* Data
    * `data()`
    * Group data with Google forms
    * `fetchData()` and requesting a repository name
    * distributing other kinds of files, e.g. templates for .Rmd, scripts, ...
* Style
    * Don't use one-letter names in your examples.  Your students will pick this up and end up saying things like `c = makeFun(x~x)`, which will mask `base::c()` and mess everything up until you `remove(c)`
