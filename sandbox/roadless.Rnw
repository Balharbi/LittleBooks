\paragraph{Warmup}

Assume that a pollster takes a poll of 1500 individuals, and the true population 
parameter (proportion) is equal to 0.50.  What is the associated 95\% confidence 
interval for a proportion in this setting (recall that $\hat{p}$ is a binomial random variable with mean equal to $p=0.5$ and variance equal to $p \cdot (1-p)/1500$.

\paragraph{Roadless America}

Wilderness is, by definition, roadless.  Untouched areas provide important habitat and play a key role in ensuring ecological balance. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, roads affect the ecology of at least 22\% of the land area of the continental United States. Knowing what portion of the US is within 1 mile of a road can help determine wilderness areas since there is a link between access by road and human presence.

A conservation policy called \emph{roadless area conservation} aims to limit road construction in order to halt negative environmental impact on designated public lands. The US Forest Service has formalized the concept of \emph{Inventoried Roadless Areas} as lands identified by governmental agencies without roads that could be candidates for roadless area conservation. According to the US Forest Service, inventoried roadless areas comprise only 2\% of the land in the continental United States.

This activity is intended to help reinforce concepts of sampling and confidence intervals while simultaneously understanding how to estimate the proportion of the United States that is within 1 mile of a road. 

You will work in pairs, and will need one computer per group.  Please download and run the first block of code in the file {\tt 2013-03-13.R} on Moodle (under lecture notes).  
This will create a data frame called {\tt myroadless}.

Now, one at a time, run the {\tt getLocation()} commands (one for each of the 20 locations you randomly sampled), taking notes of whether it was within the continental US, if so, whether it was within a mile of a road, as well as any notes.

\noindent
Calculate the number within both the continental US and 1 mile of a road ($X$), as well as the total number within the continent
($n$).  This ratio is your observed proportion.  Also calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the population proportion, using the formula: $\hat{p} \pm 1.96*\sqrt(\hat{p}*(1-\hat{p})/n)$ where $n$ is the number
within the continent.  The command {\tt require(mosaic); binom.test(x, n)} will calculate this infterval for you.  Add this interval on the board (along with your values of $X$ and $n$).

{\bf Deliverable}: to receive full credit for this activity, you need to email Nick your completed {csv} file (all fields filled in for your 20 locations), with the subject line: {\tt MTH241 Roadless} that is also cc'ed to your project group member.  Deadline for submission: 5:00pm EDT on Friday, March 15th.

\paragraph{West Wing}

Confidence intervals and prediction intervals in practice: Case study of the use of proportions in real life (polling in West Wing: "Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics", Season 1).  Can you identify when the following issues arise?
\begin{description}
\item[Sampling error] ``Inside the plus or minus" (aka margin of error)

\item[Non-sampling error] question wording

\item[Non-sampling error] non-response bias

\item[Average (trimmed mean)] ``tossing the East German judge"

\item[Good response rate] quality of data collection
\end{description}
