While not generally a major topic in introductory courses, power and sample size calculations
help to reinforce key ideas in statistics.  In this section, we will explore how \R\ can 
be used to undertake power calculations using analytic approaches.
We consider a simple problem with two tests (t-test and
sign test) of
a one-sided comparison.

We will compare the power of the sign test and the power of the test based on normal theory (one sample one sided t-test) assuming that $\sigma$ 
is known.
Let $X_1, ..., X_{25}$ be i.i.d. $N(0.3, 1)$ (this is the alternate that we wish to calculate power for).  Consider testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu=0$ versus $H_A: \mu>0$ at significance level $\alpha=.05$.  

\section{Sign test}

We start by calculating the Type I error rate for the sign test.  Here we want to
reject when the number of positive values is large.  Under the null hypothesis, this is
distributed as a Binomial random variable with n=25 trials and p=0.5 probability of being
a positive value.  Let's consider values between 15 and 19.

<<pbinom>>=
xvals <- 15:19
probs <- 1 - pbinom(xvals, size=25, prob=0.5)
cbind(xvals, probs)
qbinom(.95, size=25, prob=0.5)
@
So we see that if we decide to reject when the number of positive values is
17 or larger, we will have an $\alpha$ level of \Sexpr{round(1-pbinom(16, 25, 0.5), 3)},
which is near the nominal value in the problem.

We calculate the power of the sign test as follows. The probability that $X_i > 0$, given that $H_A$ is true is given by:
<<pnorm1>>=
1 - pnorm(0, mean=0.3, sd=1)
@
We can view this graphically using the command:
\begin{center}
<<pnorm2,fig.width=5,fig.height=1.9>>= 
xpnorm(0, mean=0.3, sd=1, lower.tail=FALSE)
@
\end{center}
The power under the alternative is equal to the probability of getting 17 or more positive values,
given that $p=0.6179$:

\Rindex{pbinom()}%
<<pbinom2>>=
1 - pbinom(16, size=25, prob=0.6179)
@
The power is modest at best.

\section{T-test}

We next calculate the power of the test based on normal theory.  To keep the comparison
fair, we will set our $\alpha$ level equal to 0.05388.

<<tidy=FALSE>>=
alpha <- 1-pbinom(16, size=25, prob=0.5); alpha
@

First we find the rejection region.  
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
n <- 25; sigma <- 1 # given
stderr <- sigma/sqrt(n)
zstar <- qnorm(1-alpha, mean=0, sd=1)
zstar
crit <- zstar*stderr
crit
@


\noindent
Therefore, we reject for observed means greater than \Sexpr{round(crit,3)}.  

To calculate the power of this one-sided test we find the probability
under the alternative hypothesis 
to the right of this cutoff.

<<>>=
power <- 1 - pnorm(crit, mean=0.3, sd=stderr)
power
@

The power of the test based on normal theory is \Sexpr{round(power,3)}.
To provide a check (or for future calculations of this sort) we can use the 
\function{power.t.test()} function.
<<>>=
power.t.test(n=25, delta=.3, sd=1, sig.level=alpha, alternative="one.sided",
type="one.sample")$power
@

This analytic (formula-based approach) yields a similar estimate to the value that we calculated directly.  

Overall, we see that the t-test has higher power than the sign test, if the underlying
data are truly normal.  \FoodForThought{It's useful to have students calculate power empirically, 
to demonstrate the power of simulations.}
\begin{problem}
\label{prob:power1}%
Find the power of a two-sided two-sample t-test where both distributions 
are approximately normally distributed with the same standard deviation, but the group differ by 50\% of the standard deviation.  Assume that there are 
\Sexpr{n}
observations per group and an alpha level of \Sexpr{alpha}.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<setup1,echo=FALSE>>=
n <- 100
alpha <- 0.01
@
<<power>>=
n
alpha
power.t.test(n=n, delta=.5, sd=1, sig.level=alpha)
@
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Find the sample size needed to have 90\% power for a two group t-test
where the true 
difference between means is 25\% of the standard deviation in the groups
(with $\alpha=0.05$).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<power2>>=
power.t.test(delta=.25, sd=1, sig.level=alpha, power=0.90)
@
\end{solution}
