\label{sec:cross}

Cross classification (two-way or $R$ by $C$) tables can be constructed for
two (or more) categorical variables.  Here we consider the contingency table
for homeless status (homeless one or more nights in the past 6 months or housed) 
and sex.

<<homeless-sex>>=
tally(~ homeless + sex, margins = FALSE, data = HELPrct)     
@

We can also calculate column percentages:
\Rindex{tally()}%
<<homeless-sex-row,tidy=FALSE>>=
tally(~ sex | homeless, margins = TRUE, format = "percent", 
  data = HELPrct)     
@

We can calculate the odds ratio directly from the table:
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
OR <- (40/169)/(67/177)
OR
@

The
\pkg{mosaic} package has a function which will calculate odds ratios:
\Rindex{oddsRatio()}%
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
oddsRatio(tally(~ (homeless == "housed") + sex, margins = FALSE, 
  data = HELPrct)) 
@

The \function{CrossTable()} function in the \pkg{gmodels} package also displays
a cross classification table.

\Rindex{CrossTable()}%
<<crosstable, message=FALSE>>=
require(gmodels)
with(HELPrct, CrossTable(homeless, sex, 
  prop.r = FALSE, prop.chisq = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE))
@

Graphical summaries of cross classification tables may be helpful in visualizing
associations.  Mosaic plots are one example, where the total area (all observations) is proportional to one.
\Caution{The jury is still out
regarding the utility of mosaic plots (also known as eikosograms), 
relative to the low data to ink ratio.\cite{Tufte:2001:Visual}%
We have found them to be helpful to reinforce understanding of a two way contingency table.}%
Here we see that males tend to be over-represented
amongst the homeless subjects (as represented by the horizontal line which is higher for
the homeless rather than the housed).  
\FoodForThought{The \function{mosaic()} function 
in the \pkg{vcd} package also makes mosaic plots.}
\Rindex{mosaicplot()}%
\begin{center}
<<mosaicplot,fig.height=3.5,tidy=FALSE>>=
mytab <- tally(~ homeless + sex, margins = FALSE, 
  data = HELPrct)
mosaicplot(mytab)
@
\end{center}

\section{Creating tables from summary statistics}

Tables can be created from summary statistics using the \function{do} function.

<<>>=
HELPtable <- rbind(
  do(40)  * data.frame(sex = "female", homeless = "homeless"),
  do(169) * data.frame(sex = "male",   homeless = "homeless"),
  do(67)  * data.frame(sex = "female", homeless = "housed"),
  do(177) * data.frame(sex = "male",   homeless = "housed")
)
tally(~ homeless + sex, data = HELPtable)
@

\section{Chi-squared tests}

\Rindex{chisq.test()}%
<<chisq1,tidy=FALSE>>=
chisq.test(tally(~ homeless + sex, margins = FALSE,
  data = HELPrct), correct = FALSE)
@

There is a statistically significant association found: it is unlikely that we would observe
an association this strong if homeless status and sex were independent in the 
population.

When a student finds a significant association, 
it's important for them to be able to interpret this in the context of the problem. 
The \function{xchisq.test()} function provides additional details (observed, expected, contribution to statistic, and residual) to help with this process.
\FoodForThought{\code{x} is for eXtra.}

\Rindex{xchisq.test()}%
<<chisq2,tidy=FALSE>>=
xchisq.test(tally(~ homeless + sex, margins = FALSE,
  data = HELPrct), correct = FALSE)
@

We observe that there are fewer homeless women, and more homeless men that would be expected.

\section{Fisher's exact test}
\myindex{Fisher's exact test}%

An exact test can also be calculated.  This is computationally straightforward for 2 by 2
tables.  Options to help constrain the size of the problem for larger tables exist
(see \verb!?fisher.test()!).

\DiggingDeeper{Note the different estimate of the odds ratio from that seen in section \ref{sec:cross}.
The \function{fisher.test()} function uses a different estimator (and different interval based 
on the profile likelihood).}
\Rindex{fisher.test()}%
<<help-fisher,tidy=FALSE>>=
fisher.test(tally(~ homeless + sex, margins = FALSE,
  data = HELPrct))
