\section{A dichotomous predictor: numerical and graphical summaries}
Here we will compare the distributions of CESD scores by sex.
The \function{mean()} function can be used to calculate the mean CESD score
separately for males and females.
\Rindex{mean()}%
<<aggregate>>=
mean(cesd ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
@
\Rindex{favstats()}%
The \function{favstats()} function can provide more statistics by group.

<<summary>>=
favstats(cesd ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
@


Boxplots are a particularly helpful graphical display to compare distributions.
The \function{bwplot()} function can be used to display the boxplots for the
CESD scores separately by sex.  We see from both the numerical and graphical
summaries that women tend to have slightly higher CESD scores than men.

\FoodForThought[-3cm]{Although we usually put explanatory variables along the horizontal axis,
page layout sometimes makes the other orientation preferable for these plots.}

\Rindex{bwplot()}%

<<cesd-box,fig.height=1.5>>=
gf_boxplot(cesd ~ sex, data = HELPrct) %>% 
gf_refine(coord_flip())
@

When sample sizes are small, there is no reason to summarize with a boxplot
since  \function{xyplot()} can handle categorical predictors.
Even with 10--20 observations in a group, a scatter plot is often quite readable.
Setting the alpha level helps detect multiple observations with the same value.
\FoodForThought{One of us once saw a biologist proudly present
side-by-side boxplots.  Thinking a major victory had been won, he naively
asked how many observations were in each group.  ``Four,'' replied the 
biologist.}

<<KidsFeet-xy,fig.height=1.5>>=
gf_point(sex ~ length, alpha = .6, cex = 1.4, data = KidsFeet)

\section{A dichotomous predictor: two-sample t}

The Student's two sample t-test can be run without (default) or with an equal variance assumption.
\Rindex{t.test()}%
\Rindex{var.equal option}%
<<HELPrct-nonpar,tidy=FALSE>>=
t.test(cesd ~ sex, var.equal = FALSE, data = HELPrct)
@
We see that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.

We can repeat using the equal variance assumption.
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
t.test(cesd ~ sex, var.equal = TRUE, data = HELPrct)
@

The groups can also be compared using the \function{lm()} function (also with an equal variance assumption).  The mosaic command \function{msummary()} provides a slightly terser version of the typical output from \function{summary()}.
\Rindex{msummary()}%
\Rindex{summary()}%
<<>>=
msummary(lm(cesd ~ sex, data = HELPrct))
@

\FoodForThought[1cm]{The \function{lm} function is part of a much more flexible modeling framework while \function{t.test} is essentially a dead end. \function{lm} uses of the equal variance assumption. See the companion book, {\em Start Modeling in R} for more details.}%


\section{Non-parametric 2 group tests}

The same conclusion is reached using a non-parametric (Wilcoxon rank sum) test.

\Rindex{wilcox.test()}%
<<HELPrct-nonpar2>>=
wilcox.test(cesd ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
@


\section{Permutation test}
\myindex{resampling}%
\myindex{permutation test}%


Here we extend the methods introduced in section \ref{sec:bootstrapsing} to 
undertake a two-sided test comparing the ages at baseline by gender.  First we calculate the observed difference in means:
\Rindex{diffmean()}%
\Rindex{shuffle()}%
<<>>=
mean(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
test.stat <- diffmean(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
test.stat
@
We can calculate the same statistic after shuffling the group labels:
<<>>=
do(1) * diffmean(age ~ shuffle(sex), data = HELPrct)
do(1) * diffmean(age ~ shuffle(sex), data = HELPrct)
do(3) * diffmean(age ~ shuffle(sex), data = HELPrct)
@

\DiggingDeeper{More details and examples can be found in the
\pkg{mosaic} package Resampling Vignette.}
\Rindex{xlim option}%
\Rindex{groups option}%
<<permute-HELPrct,fig.keep='last', tidy=FALSE>>=
rtest.stats <- do(500) * diffmean(age ~ shuffle(sex), 
  data = HELPrct)
rtest.stats <- mutate(rtest.stats, diffmeantest = ifelse(diffmean >= test.stat, TRUE, FALSE))
head(rtest.stats, 3)
favstats(~ diffmean, data = rtest.stats)
gf_histogram(~ diffmean, n = 40, xlim = c(-6, 6),
  fill = ~ diffmeantest, pch = 16, cex = .8, 
  data = rtest.stats) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = ~ test.stat, color = "red", lwd = 3)
@

Here we don't see much evidence to contradict the null hypothesis that men and 
women 
have the same mean age in the population.

\section{One-way ANOVA}
\myindex{one-way ANOVA}%
\myindex{analysis of variance}%

Earlier comparisons were between two groups. We can also consider testing differences between
three or more groups using one-way ANOVA.  Here we compare
CESD scores by primary substance of abuse (heroin, cocaine, or alcohol) with a line rather a dot to indicate the median.

\Rindex{bwplot()}%
\begin{center}
<<cesd-oneway,fig.width=6,fig.height=1.9>>=
gf_boxplot(cesd ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
@
\end{center}



<<aggregate2>>=
mean(cesd ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
@
\Rindex{aov()}%
<<help-aov>>=
anovamod <- aov(cesd ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
summary(anovamod)
@
While still high (scores of 16 or more are generally considered to be 
``severe'' symptoms), the cocaine-involved group tend to have lower 
scores than those whose primary substances are alcohol or heroin.
<<help-aovlm>>=
modintercept <- lm(cesd ~ 1, data = HELPrct)
modsubstance <- lm(cesd ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
@

The \function{anova()} command can summarize models.
\Rindex{anova()}%
<<>>=
anova(modsubstance)
@

In this setting the results are identical (since there is only one predictor, with 2 df).

The \function{anova()} function can also be used to formally 
compare two (nested) models.
\myindex{model comparison}%
<<help-aov-more>>=
anova(modintercept, modsubstance)
@


\section{Tukey's Honest Significant Differences}
\myindex{Tukey's HSD}%
\myindex{honest significant differences}%
\myindex{multiple comparisons}%

There are a variety of multiple comparison procedures that can be
used after fitting an ANOVA model.  One of these is Tukey's Honest
Significant Differences (HSD).  Other options are available within the 
\pkg{multcomp} package.

<<help-hsd>>=
favstats(cesd ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
@
\Rindex{TukeyHSD()}%
\Rindex{factor()}%
\Rindex{levels option}%
\Rindex{labels option}%
\Rindex{mutate()}%
\Rindex{lm()}%
<<help-hsd2,tidy=FALSE>>=
HELPrct <- mutate(HELPrct, subgrp = factor(substance, 
  levels = c("alcohol", "cocaine", "heroin"),
  labels = c("A", "C", "H")))
mod <- lm(cesd ~ subgrp, data = HELPrct)
HELPHSD <- TukeyHSD(mod, "subgrp")
HELPHSD
@
\Rindex{mplot()}%
<<help-hsd3,fig.height=3.5,fig.width=6>>=
mplot(HELPHSD)
@

Again, we see that the cocaine group has significantly lower CESD scores
than either of the other two groups.
