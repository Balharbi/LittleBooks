# Start Modeling Early: Outline of Version 2

## 1. Foundations: Computing

1. Data
2. Computing template

## 2. Foundations: Functions and relationships

1. Informal from graphics
#. Formal from fits
#. What do they mean
    a. Graphs
    #. Slopes and effect size
    #. R^2
#. Complex models
    a. You won't need them much, but if you must, try `poly()`
    #. Multiple variables is often more important than complex forms.

## 3. Multiple Variables

1. Main effects
#. Interaction
#. Partial derivatives
#. Adjustment -- holding covariates constant
#. R^2 goes up

## 4. Inference

## 5. Proportions
